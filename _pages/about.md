Hello, welcome to my website. I’m a PhD Student in the lab of [Dr. Jonathan Losos](https://sites.wustl.edu/losos/) at Washington University in St. Louis, where I’m studying evolutionary biology. I’m also a Research Fellow in the [Department of Vertebrate Zoology](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/vertebrate-zoology), at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. I received my undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of North Carolina Asheville, conducting research in the lab of [Dr. R. Graham Reynolds](https://reynoldslab.wp.unca.edu/). I’m an avid naturalist and broadly passionate about the study and conservation of biodiversity. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
