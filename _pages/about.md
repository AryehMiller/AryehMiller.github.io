Hello, welcome to my website. I’m a graduate student in the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, where I study the predictability of evolution through the lens of genomics and phylogenetics in the lab of [Dr. Jonathan Losos](https://sites.wustl.edu/losos/). I received my undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of North Carolina Asheville, conducting phylogenetics research in the lab of [Dr. R. Graham Reynolds](https://reynoldslab.wp.unca.edu/). I’m an avid naturalist, and broadly passionate about understanding the diversity of life through the use of big data, genomics, and statistical inference and machine learning.
