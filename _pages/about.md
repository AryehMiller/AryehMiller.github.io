<p style="text-align:justify"> I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the Montreal Lab of <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/en/">Borealis AI</a>. I completed my graduate studies in the department of Management Sciences at the University of Waterloo, Canada. During masters, my research focused on the applications of deep learning to natural language processing. My thesis was on the topic <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09012.pdf">Natural Language Generation with Neural Variational Models</a>. My research supervisor at the University of Waterloo was Prof. <a href="http://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/index.html">Olga Vechtomova</a> and I have also worked closely with Dr. <a href="https://lili-mou.github.io"> Lili Mou</a>. </p> 

<p style="text-align:justify"> My recent interests include (1) generative models for text using variational auto-encoders; (2) learning disentangled representations for controlled text generation/style transfer; and (3) multi-modal learning with audio and text data. Previously, I have worked on tasks such as sentiment analysis, rumour stance classification, relationship extraction and community question answering. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Prior to this, I was working as an analyst at Citibank. I am an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, having graduated in 2015 with a dual degree in Transportation Engineering. My research at IITM focused on applications of machine learning on traffic data and travel time prediction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I have always been fascinated by data science because it enables in rational decision making based on what the data tells us. With interests in the areas of statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning and natural language processing, I wish to share my learning and experiences through this blog.</p>
