Hello, welcome to my website. I’m a PhD Student in the lab of [Dr. Jonathan Losos](https://sites.wustl.edu/losos/) at Washington University in St. Louis, where I’m studying evolutionary biology. I received my undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of North Carolina Asheville, conducting research in the lab of [Dr. R. Graham Reynolds](https://reynoldslab.wp.unca.edu/). I’m an avid naturalist, and broadly passionate about the study and conservation of biodiversity using tools in genomics and statistics.
