Hello, welcome to my website. I’m a graduate student in the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, where I study the genomic basis of adaptation and macroevolutionary dynamics in the lab of [Dr. Jonathan Losos](https://sites.wustl.edu/losos/). I've previously worked in translational genome analytics, statistical genetics, and epigenomics at Merck. I’m an avid naturalist, and broadly passionate about understanding diversity of life through the use of big data, genomics, and statistical inference.
