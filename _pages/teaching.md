### **Bio 3501: Evolution**

_Fall 2021_

As a teaching assistant for _Evolution_, I attended biweekly lectures and led weekly discussion sections where students would grapple with recent peer-reviewed articles in the evolutionary biology literature to better understand the wide-range of concepts, hypotheses, and theories in evolutionary biology. I additionally held weekly office hours, and held several exam review sessions.

### **Bio 3501: Intro to Ecology**

_Spring 2023_
