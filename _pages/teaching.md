**Washington University in St. Louis**

### **Bio 3501: Evolution**

_Fall 2021_

I was teaching assistant for Dr. Ken Olsen's "Evolution" course, where I attended biweekly lectures and lead weekly discussion sections where students would grapple with recent peer-reviewed articles in the evolutionary biology literature. I additionally held weekly office hours, and held several exam review sessions.
