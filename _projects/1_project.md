Key innovation are novel organismal features that facilitate major ecological shifts. For example, the evolution of wings in birds enabled access to entirely new suite of ecological resources. My research on key innovations aims to synthesize the initial ecological origins of the concept--understanding form and function--with more recent advances in phylogenetic comparative biology to integratively meld both evolution and ecology. 

The first portion (Miller and Stroud 2022) of research describes a novel conceptual and empirical comparative framework for understanding how key innovations arise, and inferring the eco-evolutionary dynamics of these traits through time.

    Arboreal lizards come in all shapes and sizes. On the left, a flying lizard (genus Draco) with an expanded rib cage to allow the species to "glide." Middle, an arboreal lizard with long, sharp curved claws to dig into trunks. Right, a gecko without toepads-- the bent-toed geckos, which have evolved arboreality.

    Arboreality in lizards has evolved more than 100 times, but lineages possessing digital adhesive toepads have a distinct, remarkable evolutionary dynamic through time of ecological conservatism.
