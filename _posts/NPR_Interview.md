I was invited on to St. Louis National Public Radio to discuss a recent study I led (published in Sytematic Biology) on the evolution of arboreality in lizards. The interview, and corresponding article, is available <a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/show/st-louis-on-the-air/2021-08-18/wash-u-biologist-explains-how-lizards-evolved-for-specialized-life-in-trees">on the St. Louis Public Radio website</a>.
